## Low priority

Add annotation capabilities
Add "Connect with other users/Share session data" capability
 - e.g. provide the capability for users to share data associated with the same website
 - e.g. Connect to another user's session -> create a session associate with the active website, and link it to the other user's session
 - link a session with another user's session: show (but do not edit) another user's pins alongside my own, and show the other user's annotations
