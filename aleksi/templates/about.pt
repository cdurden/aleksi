    Aleksi helps readers understand words on a Finnish webpage:
        Aleksi on <b>A</b>uttaja <b>l</b>ukemista <b>e</b>sineitä <b>k</b>ielellä <b>s</b>uomen <b>i</b>nternetissä.
    <!--Finnish readers can sign up to use Aleksi by entering an email address on the sign-up form. Now that I have signed up, I will load my favorite Finnish news site into Aleksi by entering the website's URL into my Aleksi sessions page. Once the website has been loaded, I can ask Aleksi for help by clicking on a Finnish word.
    -->
    Aleksi uses linguistics software to identify word parts and present their translations.
    <!--I will pin the words that I have encountered, along with their translations, so that I can review them later. -->
    Readers can pin words that they encounter, along with their translations, so that the vocabulary can be reviewed later.
    Pinned words can also be synced with Quizlet so that readers can study them using Quizlet's study tools.
